 * User FDs
 *
 * There are a bunch of Linux APIs that we can implement in userspace that use
 * FDs as a handle.  Eventually that handle gets passed to close().  User FDs
 * are a chunk of reserved numbers in the space of FDs, used by various
 * userspace libraries that use FDs as their API.
 *
 * The user FD space starts where the kernel's leaves off.  Currently, the
 * kernel claims 19 bits of the 32 bit int for an FD.  The MSB flags whether it
 * is negative or not.  That leaves 12 bits for us. */
